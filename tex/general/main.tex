\subsection{Whitespace}
Whitespace is ignored in Doublesing, expect for one character: the blank newline.
A blank newline is a single line, by itself. As C printf escape sequences, it is:
\begin{verbatim}
\n\r\n\r
\end{verbatim}

This will cause a new \begin{verbatim}<p>\end{verbatim} tag to be inserted inside of direct-display blocks.

\subsection{Blocks}
A block is defined by an identifier and one or more arguments, which should be text surrounded by the characters "\{" and "\}".
A valid block identifier can be matched by the regex:
\begin{verbatim}
/[a-zA-Z0-9_].+/
\end{verbatim}

By convention, all the built-in block types use lowercase names, with words separated by underscores.
Vendors are encouraged (but not required) to use the same convention.

\subsection{Arguments}
Arguments to blocks are evaluated at the deepest level first, then expand outwards through the tree.

As an example:

\begin{verbatim}
\link{www.imagehex.com}{\bold{Free} advertising for the author!}
\end{verbatim}

Becomes:
\begin{verbatim}
\link{www.imagehex.com}{<b>free</b> advertising for the author!}
\end{verbatim}
Which then becomes:
\begin{verbatim}
<a href="wwww.imagehex.com"><b>free</b> advertising for the author!</a>
\end{verbatim}
